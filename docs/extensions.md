# Extensions

Support for additional effects can be added with `addEffectHandler()`. A new effect handler can also make use of other effects (e.g. nested effects) by using `handleEffect()`.

### `addEffectHandler(name, handler)`
### `handleEffect(effect, doneFn, proc)`

### `Handler`
### `FnHandler`
